# SilverBook

SilverBook is an Android App that helps students predict their G.P.A., manage their scores and manage their attendance.

## Why SilverBook

In IIIT-A and many other colleges, students get their G.P.A. after the end term exams and there is nothing that can be done to improve them. SilverBook is an android app that enables users to predict their GPA right from the first test, so that they know where they stand at the moment and can pour in required efforts accordingly. Additionaly there is an attendance management feature that keeps a track of your attendance and tells you the number of classes you can bunk/must attend to get your attendance on track.
